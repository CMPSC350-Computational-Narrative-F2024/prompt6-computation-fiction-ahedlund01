In a world where shadows hold memories, a girl named Lila loses her shadow. Without her shadow, Lila feels very lonely, like a part of her is missing, leaving her empty and sad.

Finding the Lost Shadow
Lila wants her shadow back, so she goes on a journey to find it. She finds an old, fancy mirror in a dark attic covered in cobwebs. The mirror's surface glows with a strange light, like liquid silver, pulling her in. She takes a deep breath and steps through it into a magical place called the "Noonless Realm." It's a place where all the lost shadows go. The shadows there are angry and want to be free. Lila finds her own shadow, but now it is leading the other shadows. It wants to stay free and not return.

Facing the Sad Memories
Lila talks to her shadow and realizes she has to remember all the sad things she tried to forget. Lila tells her shadow she is ready to share those feelings. If Lila does this, her shadow will help her stop the other shadows from causing trouble. The shadows are making the world unbalanced, and Lila's bravery makes her shadow agree to help.

Making Peace with the Shadows
Lila and her shadow talk to the other shadows. Lila tells them it's important to accept all parts of themselves, even the sad ones. Slowly, the shadows listen and return to their humans, helping fix the world.

Finally, Lila's shadow returns to her, and she feels whole again, filled with warmth and peace she hasn't felt in a long time. She knows she must love every part of herself, even the sad parts. The magical world fades away, and Lila finds herself back in the attic. Her shadow is right beside her, and together they step into the sunlight, ready for whatever comes next.
